# Samples
Language samples.

# Purpose
The purpose of this module is to showcase intermediate and advanced concepts of the language. \
This is not a complete or whole set and is not meant as a finished library nor production ready. \
This is meant for learnings and tutorials that can be successfully compiled and executed. \
Purpose of which is to use as a collection of code snippets that cover a broad list of categories.
